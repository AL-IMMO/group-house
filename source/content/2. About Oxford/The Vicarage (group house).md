- Group house in Oxford

Spareroom.co.uk listing from 2025-09-11

Hello! We are the Vicarage, a shared house in New Hinksey (south Oxford) and we are looking for someone to fill a room from mid-October onwards! We are a shared house of 7 lovely individuals (young professionals). We love cooking dinners for each other (mostly plant based/veggie), hanging out, playing board games, watching movies on our projector and spending time outdoors together.  
  
The house has 3.5 bathrooms, two kitchens, a washing machine, a drier, a bike shed and a small “garden” (it was once a parking lot, but now has comfy benches and flower beds). A bathing lake and park are five minutes walk away. There is a farmers market on Sundays where we get fresh bread, vegetables and fruits for extensive brunching (friends and neighbors often pop in for this!).  
  
If this sounds like a place that you’d enjoy living at or if you have any questions, please get in touch by the email below! If you feel comfortable, please tell us about yourselves and why you would be a good fit for the house!  
  
Move-in date: 15th of October (move-in date can be flexible)  
Current rent (without bills): £525  
Bills: £50-60  
Council Tax: (£22 for a student, £53 for a professional)  
We bulk order shared groceries every 3 months from infinity orders  
Smoking: outdoors  
  
To make communications more manageable please send an email describing yourself and what you would bring to the house to: vicaragehouse[at]gmx. com  
  
If we like your message, we’ll arrange an interview sometime in the beginning/mid September during a weekday between 6-9PM.  
  
Ideally looking for someone who wants to stay min. 12 months!
