- [[What we're looking for in a group house]]
- [[Alex]]
- Really what I'm looking for is a nice group of friends! I don't think it's much more sophisticated than that are the moment
- We have vague but alive-feeling plans to form a Fractal-type community, but that feels a bit down the road for me - in the "Maslow's hierarchy of needs" thing, I'd just love to have a solid core group first
- I'm kind of an ambivert - happy doing stuff on my own, but also wanting to shift into doing less stuff on my own, after a few years of digital nomad-ing
# What am I *not* looking for in a group house
- I have some aversion to the Effective Altruism scene, so I wouldn't like to live in a house that feels really EA-focused
- I have a fear that Simmo wants a house that is super extroverted and raucous and dance-focused etc (I don't think this is actually want he wants, it's just a part of me that fears this). I want to be able to show up in a comfortably quiet/still way and not feel like I have to be high energy all the time
