- Hello! 
- We're Alex and Simmo and we're looking to form a Fractal-inspired group house in Oxford, UK!

# Our dream group house
## 1. Fractal-inspired
### 1a. What is Fractal?
- Fractal began with [Fractal NYC](https://fractalnyc.com/)

> "In 2021, our small group of friends decided to live, learn, and build together in NYC. 
> It started as just a ==single apartment with weekly dinners== where people gave 5-minute talks. 
> And it grew into a ==neighborhood campus=="
### 1b. Why Fractal?
#### Power of in-person community
- We're both believers in both the ==power of living in community==. Simmo is a long-time believer in community and has been nagging me (Alex here, hi!) for years about how it's clearly the best way to live, and I've been convinced of this recently (much to my chagrin at admitting that Simmo was right all along)
- Simmo 
	- Has lived ...
	- He also has this insane [list of communities](https://www.simmosimpson.com/Communities-List), and recently wrote "[29 weeks living in communities](https://simmosimpson.substack.com/p/29-weeks-living-in-communities)"
	- [Fool's Valley (Portugal)](https://foolsvalley.com/), [Transformational Connection Hub (Portugal)](https://www.transformationalconnection.com/transformational-connection-house-booking), [Life Itself (France)](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac), [The Garden (Portugal)](www.thegarden.pt)
- Alex
	- Has lived at [Life Itself in Bergerac, France](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac), an intentional group house in Toronto, a intentional group house in London, and attended [Ship It Week](https://www.alexislearning.me/to-live-well/4.-Connect-with-people/Notes/What-is-Ship-It-Week-(2025-08-20)) at the end of August 
	- Vignettes ([1](https://www.alexislearning.me/to-live-well/3.-Create-things/Writings/08.-Morning-by-the-pool), [2](https://www.alexislearning.me/to-live-well/3.-Create-things/Writings/10.-After-%22Ship-It-Week%22)) written from Ship It Week
#### Atomisation of the default way of living
- We also agree with the thesis of the ==loneliness crisis/meaning crisis== (shoutout John Vervaeke), the atomisation of the default ways of living (e.g., house shares with randos who you aren't value-aligned with), modernity, etc
#### Intentional communities are great but ephemeral
- We've both lived in intentional communities around the world (France, Spain, Portugal, Bali), and find that whilst they offer ==great short-term connections==, they are by their nature ephemeral (visa issues, high turnover). We want the benefit of intentional community living, over the span on ==multiple years, not just multiple months==

#### Fractal as a model for rebuilding civic society 
- Whilst also not getting too heady/dramatic about it → see Evelyn's tweet of "do you want x or do you just want a friend group", below
	- Which tbf I think the Fractal people would endorse. Start small and local.

- Great talk by [Tyler Alterman](https://x.com/tyleralterman) at Fractal → "[Fractal’s emerging civic society](https://fractalnyc.com/fractals-emerging-civic-society)"
### 1c. What does a Fractal-inspired group house look like?
1. Our initial plan is a ==centrally located group house to act as a third space== for people to come hang out
2. From there, we can grow to do things like ==group classes==
	- See Priya's "[How to Start a School With Your Friends](https://prigoose.substack.com/p/how-to-start-a-university?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=dk8r8&triedRedirect=true)"
	- See Mosaic's [Mosaic University](https://mosaic-london.super.site/university) page
	- See FractalNYC's [FractalU: Fall Semester 2025](https://fractalnyc.notion.site/FractalU-Fall-Semester-2025-2308262d069080e38f3cf9ce2376a5d9) page
3. And helping set up ==more group houses== within walking distance

### 1d. How do we set up a Fractal-inspired group house?
1. We're on the waitlist for Tyler & Priya's [Campus Accelerator Program](https://fractalcampus.com/) (was due to start on 1st Sep 2025 but was delayed)
2. We have friends who have started Fractal-inspired hubs
	- [Mosaic](https://mosaic-london.super.site/) in London → recommend checking out their site!
	- [Weave Toronto](https://weavetoronto.notion.site/) 
	- We're also connected to Tyler/Priya/Andrew (the 3 main FractalNYC people) and have links to [Portal](https://portalporto.super.site/)
### Appendix
- [[Other Fractal hubs]]
## 2. Location
- We want to be as close to the centre as possible, to make it easy for people to visit!

- Authentic Relating, Circling
- Dance, music
- Mix of introversion and extroversion. Not too heady, not too woo
